### Security System for a Topology built in GNS3

Assalamu Alaikum everyone,
In this project We have built a security system on a topology/network inside GNS3 to prevent it from Cyber attack such as **SQL Injection** and so on.

Now a days all Website, Apps we use by connecting to the internet are vulnerable to many cyber attacks. As a result all our public and private data going in the wrong hands. Data breach like these can cause many problems to us. So to prevent problem like these we need to secure the we have to take some masures.

So we have built a topology consists of 4 routers which contains their own networks consists of one switch and a PC. One of the PC is acting as a Web Server.

### Firewall Configuration <br> <br><br>

The Firewall will have 2 interfaces s1/0 and s1/2. Interface **s1/0** will be connected to **Router-5** and Interface **s1/2** will be connected to **Router-2**.

Initial Firewall terminal commands are given below:
```
conf t

    int s1/0
        ip address 60.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
        no shut
        exit

    int s1/2
        ip address 50.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
        no shut
        exit

    router ospf 1

        network 50.0.0.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
        network 60.0.0.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
        end
```
<br><br>
```
show  ip int brief

<br><br>
```
show  ip route
```

<br><br>
```
show  ip ospf route
```

<br><br>
```
show  ip ospf int
```

<br><br>
```
show  ip ospf neigh detail
```

<br><br>


The user of the hacker PC is trying to hack into our Website using Burp Suite<br>
![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60141836/209617812-a5badce9-9879-4042-920d-fb680acc7004.png)

<br><br>

We can determine it by monitoring all the incoming and outgoing packets from our server PC. We can monitor the packets using Wireshark. To monitor the packets first I'll **Right click** on the link on the server and click on **Start capture**<br>
![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60141836/209617818-10175bbe-8752-4bed-a844-d2a66244fbde.png)

<br><br>

Click **OK**<br>
![8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60141836/209617820-670bde7b-9d50-478c-b762-7a4ad56508b7.png)

<br><br>

Here we can see an icon looks like an magnifying glass<br>
![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60141836/209617821-e3904080-6c23-4f7d-aa4f-4011b6171949.png)

<br><br>

Wireshark will start up and we will be able watch all the incoming and outgoing packets<br>
![10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60141836/209617822-00065ca5-bc3b-4f71-a9b6-8751732b487f.png)

<br><br>

Here we can see that a lot of TCP request is comming from **192.16.68.60**, that means this is the Hacker PC. We can filter by its IP address to see all the request coming from it. To do that I'll **Right click** on one request from **192.16.68.60** then click **Apply as filter**->**Selected**<br>
![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60141836/209617823-470fcbea-8d80-4d17-8ab1-113903b384dc.png)

<br><br>

Now I'll configure the Firewall to block the IP address **192.16.68.60**
```
conf t
    ip access-list extended BLOCK
        deny tcp host 192.16.68.60 host 172.16.68.50
        permit ip any any
        end

conf t
    int s1/0
        ip access-group BLOCK in
        end
```

<br><br>

We can verify the Access List by the command
```
show access-lists
```
![13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60141836/209617827-b7e6eb58-d7d4-4091-adfc-7563b571bfd2.png)

<br><br>

After doing that we can see that there is no new incoming TCP request from the hacker PC<br>
![14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60141836/209617831-8f283ab7-7984-44d8-8ba2-f3c2de248c64.png)
<br><br>

Also the hacker can no longer access our website<br>
![15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60141836/209617835-5c06d585-5652-472b-95f4-c5f88ccc8e40.png)
<br><br>

Thus it can be said that our server is secure.
